# Shiryoku-Web

This WebUI is dedicated to [Shiryoku](https://github.com/Robin-Van-de-Merghel/Shiryoku) which is a [IVRE](https://github.com/ivre/ivre)-like project. 

This WebUI, unlike Shiryoku itself, is heavily based on [Claude](https://claude.ai)'s work as I am not a frontend developer.

> ![IMPORTANT]
> I do not encourage people to use AI. It helped me produce a quick *POC* waiting for me to invest some time on the frontend project. Code reviews will need to be performed.
